<span style="font-size: 18px;"> I am currently a Ph.D. student in computer science at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/" target="_black">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/" target="_blank">Prof.Amir Houmansadr</a>. My research is centered on **Privacy and Security in AI**. Lately, my work has involved exploring the trustworthiness of generative models, and I am deeply intrigued by the complexities of adversarial attacks and the adversarial training techniques that improve the resilience of AI model across various of domains.</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px;"> I earned my B.Eng in Computer Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in the year 2023, where I completed my Final Year Thesis (FYT) under the supervision of <a href="https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/" target="_black">Prof. Jun Zhang</a> in "Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning".</span>
