I am a staff research scientist at Field AI working with Dr. Shayegan Omidshafiei and Dr. Ali Agha to develop field foundation models. Before joining Field AI, I was a research scientist at LG AI Research, where I developed large language model agents to navigate web environments with Prof. Honglak Lee.

I received my M.S./Ph.D. from MIT, studying multiagent reinforcement learning (doctoral thesis committee: Prof. Jonathan P. How, Prof. Jakob N. Foerster, and Prof. Pulkit Agrawal). Prior to my graduate study, I received a B.S. (summa cum laude) from Cornell and worked on computer vision research (advisor: Prof. Tsuhan Chen).

I am a recipient of the Kwanjeong Educational Foundation Fellowship, and have spent time at LG AI Research (advisor: Prof. Honglak Lee), CMU-RI (advisor: Prof. Sebastian Scherer) and TTIC (advisor: Prof. Matthew R. Walter).
