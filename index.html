I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof.Amir Houmansadr](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/). I'm actively researching on the trustworthiness of generative models, and I am also fascinated by the complexities of adversarial attacks and the methods involved in adversarial training, which pla crucial roles in improving resilience of models across diverse domains.
